# NBA API Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Strategy

Based on your previous experience with NBA APIs, here's the optimal development path:

## Phase 1: Immediate Start (Week 1-2)
### TheSportsDB API ✅
**Status**: Working now, ready to use
```python
# No setup required - just use it!
import requests

url = "https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3/search_all_teams.php?l=NBA"
response = requests.get(url)
teams = response.json()
```

**Best for**: Team data, basic info, MVP development

## Phase 2: Player Data (Week 3-4)
### balldontlie.io API 🔑
**Status**: Requires registration (you've used this before)

**Setup Steps**:
1. Go to https://www.balldontlie.io/
2. Register for free API access
3. Get your API key
4. Update your code with authentication

```python
# With API key
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
url = "https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players"
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

**Best for**: Player profiles, basic stats, search functionality

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Week 5+)
### NBA Stats API (Official) 🏆
**Status**: You have experience - perfect for advanced features!

**Setup Steps**:
```bash
pip install nba_api
```

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import playergamelog
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import teamgamelog
from nba_api.stats.static import players

# Example: Get player stats
player_dict = players.find_players_by_full_name('LeBron James')
lebron_id = player_dict[0]['id']
lebron_gamelog = playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(player_id=lebron_id)
```

**Best for**: 
- Advanced analytics features
- Detailed player/team statistics  
- Historical data analysis
- Your data analyst background

## 🔧 Development Tips

### Hybrid Approach Benefits
1. **Start Fast**: TheSportsDB gets you going immediately
2. **Add Incrementally**: Each phase adds more capability
3. **Leverage Experience**: Use APIs you're already familiar with
4. **Scale Gradually**: Add complexity as your app grows

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
def get_team_data(team_id):
    # Try primary API first
    try:
        return get_from_thesportsdb(team_id)
    except:
        # Fallback to secondary API
        try:
            return get_from_balldontlie(team_id)
        except:
            # Ultimate fallback
            return get_from_nba_stats(team_id)
```
